## Abstract

   Technology is advancing rapidly, and everyday humanity spends an increasing amount of their day looking at screens. Many people nowadays are more concerned with their online persona than they are about their physical existence. This trend will only continue to compound. Humans in the not too distant future will have the ability to fully merge with computers, therefore living their lives in an entirely digital reality if they so choose. In 2021, these thoughts likely come as a shock to most people; however, if you simply extrapolate humanity’s technological progress since the industrial revolution into the next 100 years, and think logically about the exponentially growing capability of computers, then a future where humanity lives a significant portion of its daily life in a digital world seems highly probable. This written work presents philosophical and technical thoughts about “The Metaverse'' in order to clarify, define, and progress discussion about this future digital reality.

## Defining The Metaverse

   Wikipedia explains The Metaverse as “a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the Internet. ... The term is typically used to describe the concept of a future iteration of the internet, made up of persistent, shared, 3D virtual spaces linked into a perceived virtual universe.”

   The Metaverse is a future iteration of the Internet, significantly improved and enhanced compared to where it is today. It will one day provide the ability to fully override one’s senses of sight and hearing, and eventually even touch, smell, and taste, through the use of a brain machine interface. However, in the mean time and along the way, The Metaverse will be experienced through what we currently know as gaming, AR, and VR. In a matured form of The Metaverse, senses can be controlled to give humans as much of a sense of presence in a digital environment as they would have in a physical one, exactly as depicted in the classic film The Matrix. In the movie, the character Cypher states: “I know this steak doesn’t exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, The Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize? Ignorance is bliss.”([Link](https://youtu.be/JODWCwycNmg)) In a future iteration, humanity’s Metaverse will be just as convincing. Digital reality will be indistinguishable from physical reality, by design.

## What’s in the digital world?

   Once fully overridden, one’s senses can be controlled to perceive anything, and it would feel as real as anything else they’ve ever experienced in the physical world. Anything from dancing with friends in a nightclub, to flying at the speed of light through the solar system, to skiing from the top of Mount Everest can be experienced once designed. An “experience” being a collection of sensory overrides that work in concert to provide one with a full sense of presence in a designed digital environment. Things that are physically impossible in the real world can be easily created and take place effortlessly in a digital world. If you immerse yourself in a digital Metaverse, your reality basically becomes a video-game sandbox dreamworld, where you can make real anything that you can imagine. In addition to experiencing your own designed reality, one could also connect with other humans in the digital world, and together share uniquely designed fully immersive experiences. These experiences can be imagined and created by humans using powerful machine-learning enhanced tools, and then uploaded to the Internet for the rest of humanity to download and experience if they so choose. Epic Games’s Unreal Engine 5 in the year 2021 is already a technology that demonstrates a version of such a capability by procedurally generating strikingly realistic and beautiful looking 3D environments with relative ease. With an additional 50 to 100 years of machine learning advancements, it’s incomprehensible to imagine the capabilities of future 3D experience design tooling.

   Sharing digital experiences with other humans also offers the opportunity to uniquely customize your appearance to every last detail, and change it anytime instantly. In The Metaverse, you never have to age, thus “drinking from The Fountain of Youth” in a sense. Similar to that of experiences mentioned earlier, any attribute of your appearance that you can imagine can also be made into digital reality. If you want to look like a 25 year old supermodel for the rest of your digital life, you can. If you want to look like a fictional character for a day, you can. Anything imagined can be made real in The Metaverse.

   In 2021, a creative agency most commonly refers to a company that curates and collects art, music, design, and other creative media and then organizes that media into a piece of work that can be consumed in order to understand an idea. For example, a film studio combines video and voice audio with music in order to create a piece of art that conveys an idea more immersive than any idea understood by simply consuming either just the video or the music alone. These pieces of media are sensory inputs. Video is a visual input, voice audio an auditory input, and music also an auditory input. You can think of paintings and interior design as visual inputs, music (ie. sound art) and ambience as auditory inputs, human interaction and environment textures (eg. water) as inputs of touch, and fragrance (ie. smell art) and food (ie. culinary art) as inputs of smell and taste respectively.

> **Tangent** - Some human senses are capable of conveying ideas and emotion more deeply/differently than others: music for example seems to have the deepest ability to command one’s immediate emotions compared to the other senses. I've never gotten goosebumps while looking at a painting.

> However, the sense of vision is the most important for creating **immersion**. Sight is obviously not the _only_ sense required for full immersion, but it seems to be the most important.


## The Global Brain

   The mature Metaverse is dependent on high bandwidth, advanced brain machine interfaces that can fully and seamlessly override a person's senses in order to deliver true immersion. In order provide this capability, these devices needs to be able to interact with the brain in marvel ways not currently understood. At the highest level of abstraction, these devices need to be able to read data from the brain and write data to the brain, where data in the case of immersion is sensory inputs and outputs such as sight and audio. Excitingly, once that level of advanced capability is achieved, and productionalized, brain interfaces could likely be further innovated upon in order to work with properties of the brain other than senses. Philosphy permitting (see [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus)), a following iteration could allow for more general brain data such as ideas, knowledge, understandings, and even memories and thoughts to be read and written as well.

   Once knowledge is able to be read from and written to a person's brain, humanity will go through profound changes. TBC...
  
## The Path to The Metaverse

   Discussing, defining, and progressing towards The Metaverse is essential to human advancement. Once with a capable Metaverse and fully connected society, humanity can achieve incomprehensible levels of innovation, happiness, and fulfillment.

   The Internet will continue to progress and improve, and eventually become a recognizable version of The Metaverse as presented. The path to a future feature-full version of a Metaverse will likely be realized in incremental advancements in hardware and software immersion technologies. In 2021, desktops, laptops, and mobile phones are the main interfaces that humans use to interact with the existing primitive digital world. All three of those, and any others, can be generalized to: humans providing input to a computer with their hands and then receiving visual and auditory output. The next step towards improving the immersive capabilities of computers will likely be Virtual Reality headsets and Augmented Reality glasses. Virtual Reality completely overrides one’s sense of sight, and with headphones overrides one’s sense of sound as well: two of the five senses fully controlled. Augmented Reality mainly aims to overlay visual artifacts on top of existing biological sight, thus “augmenting” instead of fully overriding one’s sense of vision.
